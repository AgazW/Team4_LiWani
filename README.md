## Objectives
In this project we will try to answer some questions using machine learning methods.
1. Is there an association between gut microbiome and age? 
   - In other words, can we predict age from gut microbiome composition using machine learning?
2. Using machine learning based on the gur microbiome, how well can we classify different classes
   - Can our model identify important bacteria and replicate previous findings?
   - Is there systematic differences between monozygotic and dizygotic twins with regard to their microbiota composition, controlling for other confounders?
3. How accurately can we predict ancestry using gut microbiome and machine learning

Data were collected from a twin study with 281 samples and more than 5000 OTUs


## Methods and Implementation
### Preprocessing
Microbiome data goes through pre-processing before machine learning implementation.  Pre-processing transforms input data into a suitable form which the network can identify and use. Data processing goals could include reduction of input space size, smoother relationships among data, normalization, feature extraction, and noise reduction. Microbiome data produced from high-throughput sequencing often leads to a variable number of reads per sample.  Normalization ensures comparability of data across samples with differences in read depth. 

### PCA
### Machine Learning
Machine learning describes the use of algorithms to recognize, classify, and predict patterns from data (Tarca, 2007).

~~#### Random Forest
Random forest describes a supervised machine learning strategy that splits samples into successively smaller groups based on specific features and associated threshold values.~~

#### Linear SVM
Linear SVM was preformed using 10 fold cross validation with 3 repeats.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a method of supervised machine learning that is useful for classification, regression, and detection of outliers.  SVMs are effective in higher dimensions where the dimensions are greater than the numbers of samples.

#### KNN
K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression.

#### AdaBoost
Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) is a machine learning meta-algorithm that can be used to improve performance of other machine learning algorithms.
