Step 1: Literature review for high impact papers that use normalization and machine learning. 
  For example, find a paper that uses machine learning of microbiome data to predict disease. 
Step 2: Extract the most informative figure/visualization from this paper, and we will perhaps use this visualization in our paper. 

I googled: "Gordon JI machine learning normalization". Then I clicked on "Scholarly articles for Gordon JI machine learning normalization".
  Then I clicked on the following link with 4252 citations: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11053.pdf?origin=ppub
